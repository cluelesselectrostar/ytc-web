                            I recently learnt that Japan has a travel agency for stuffed animals, which appeared very amusing to me.
                            So while I am not ready to splurge large amounts on sending my dolls to travel, this is a cool idea,
                            I was thinking how I could recreate something of a similar nature.
                        </p>

                            Since I am a fan of the Underground, I have decidedto bring Woodstock on every station on the tube,
                            which will inject a bit more purpose into my frequent commuting and trainspotting trips.
                            In addition, it will be a great excuse for me to rejuvenate my abandoned photography instagram account,
                            and to learn a bit of vector graphics rendering for the web.

                                    Trains have always been a huge part of my life. As a child I was attracted to Thomas & Friends, but jokes aside, many bits of a railway entice me, whether it be rolling stock design, the timetabling logistics, the sophisticated and evolving signalling systems, and so much more!

                                    As part of my graduation trip I made the world's (distance-wise) longest and (altitude-wise) highest 55-hour sleeper service from Guangzhou/ Canton (Âª£Êù±Âª£Â∑û) to Tibet Lhasa (Ë•øËóèÊãâËñ©), where I made the first sleeper journey of my life, witnessed the gorgeous landscapes and cityscapes scrolling past my eyes, and interacted with people from diverse cultural landscapes!

                                    While I do not have a particular attachment to steam railways, a brief weekend of laborious hands-on engineering work such as track-laying and installing electrical mains, as well as working alongside experienced veterans of the industry, was ultimately rewarding and gifted me with new perspectives on the country's railways.
