                                    Trains have always been a huge part of my life. As a child I was attracted to Thomas & Friends, but jokes aside, many bits of a railway entice me, whether it be rolling stock design, the timetabling logistics, the sophisticated and evolving signalling systems, and so much more!

                                    As part of my graduation trip I made the world's (distance-wise) longest and (altitude-wise) highest 55-hour sleeper service from Guangzhou/ Canton (Âª£Êù±Âª£Â∑û) to Tibet Lhasa (Ë•øËóèÊãâËñ©), where I made the first sleeper journey of my life, witnessed the gorgeous landscapes and cityscapes scrolling past my eyes, and interacted with people from diverse cultural landscapes!

                                    While I do not have a particular attachment to steam railways, a brief weekend of laborious hands-on engineering work such as track-laying and installing electrical mains, as well as working alongside experienced veterans of the industry, was ultimately rewarding and gifted me with new perspectives on the country's railways.
