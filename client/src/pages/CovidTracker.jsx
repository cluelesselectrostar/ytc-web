                                            The dataset is maintained by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus">Our World in Data</a> and is fetched from a <a href="https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.json">JSON data source</a>. More details of the dataset indicators are available on their <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data">COVID-19 Data GitHub Repository</a>. The team deserves a great amount of respect and appreciation, as a lot of effort is spent to extract data (sometimes manually) from a number of reputable sources, such as the WHO, European CDC, and other national health agencies, making the data available in such an accessible manner.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In the world map above, a country filled in <b>black</b> indicates that relevant data is not available. This highlights the difficulties the "Our World in Data" team faces, as not all national health agencies make coronavirus data available in a complete and transparent manner. Sometimes, the data collection interval also varies, so it might be helpful to choose another date on the map above.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Projects of this nature can certainly allow the public to assess the severity of coronavirus in a more accessible and visual manner. I hope you enjoy this tool, and find some use out of this.

                                            This project is built with D3.js (and of course React, HTML, CSS....). D3 is a very useful tool for producing interactive data visualisations on the web, and I am currently in the process of learning how to use it. I do plan to learn more about it, and utilise it for my future projects. In the very near future, I will also clean the code up a bit, particularly to avoid re-grabbing data from thhe site upon loading my website each time. This will likely involve some MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) database tricks which I'm currently experimenting with.

                                            This project is heavily inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGORNzKIXL4&list=PLDZ4p-ENjbiPo4WH7KdHjh_EMI7Ic8b2B&index=14">YouTube tutorial by The Muratorium</a> and for that I must thank muratkemaldar for the extremely useful tutorial, which provided an excellent launchpad for me to explore the quirks of working with Javascript and JSON's.
