                            I have always been fascinated in the sophisticated circuits and systems powering our gadgets and appliances,
                            which is why I went for EEE.
                            I truly believe that harnessing the power of these newest technology is the way to build a smarter,
                            greener and more sustainable future. While I envision to work in an inter-disciplinary engineering environment,
                            I have developed my specific interests during my course. Some of my interests include:

                            The main takeaway of this internship was the interactive process of iterating through design and specifications,
                            and working with compliance, ensuring safe and effective completion of the project.

                            and the number of inter-university events has remarkably surpassed previous years.

                        <p>
                            Serving as training manager for robotics academy (ICRA) was one of my most rewarding commitments of the year.
                            While ICRA was previously focused on teaching schoolchildren robotics through building LEGO Mindstorms Robots,
                            in view of coronavirus,
                            we adapted our workshops to a remote-friendly format. I was charged with developing game-orientated learning workshops on Tynker,
                            where schoolchildren can learn to program various games.
                            This process not only enhanced my interest for developing games,
                            but also increased my awareness on creating workshops with educational appeal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, it's a joy working with kids, and I'm glad to be a part of their quest towards STEM!
