                            <p>
                                Trains have always been a huge part of my life. As a child I was attracted to Thomas & Friends, but jokes aside, many bits of a railway entice me, whether it be rolling stock design, the timetabling logistics, the sophisticated and evolving signalling systems, and so much more! Occasionally I seek solace in listening to motor noises from familiar rolling stock, though this probably isn't the best place to elaborate on such a niche interest.

                            <p>
                                I think the most remarkable rail journey I have made is the 55-hour sleeper service from Guangzhou/ Canton (Âª£Êù±Âª£Â∑û) to Tibet Lhasa (Ë•øËóèÊãâËñ©). That was my first time I ever went on a sleeper service, let alone one of the world's (distance-wise) longest and (altitude-wise) highest service. It was amazing to witness the diverse landscapes and cityscapes scrolling past my eyes, but getting to interact with people from diverse backgrounds was a joy as well!

                                Given my age, I do not have a particular attachment to steam railways, but I have always looked forward to witnessing the grandeur of steam railways. Working alongside experienced veterans of the industry gave me new perspectives on the country's railways, and made my first encounter with steam locomotives an absolutely remarkable experience! As a volunteer, we gained hands-on engineering experience, such as track laying and installing electrical mains at the depot, which was laborious but ultimately rewarding.

                                There are so many more journeys I would like to make post-coronavirus, and I very much look forward to them. Meanwhile, have a read at my (hopefully decently written) blogs on medium!
