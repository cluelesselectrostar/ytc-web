                    <h2>Training my mind to mind the trains üöÖ</h2>
                    <p>
                        Trains have always been a huge part of my life. As a child I was attracted to Thomas & Friends, but I doubt it is the key reason I became a rail enthusiast. Many bits of a railway entice me, whether it be rolling stock design, the logistics involved in timetabling, the sophisticated and continuously evolving signalling systems, or so much more! Occasionally I seek solace in listening to motor noises from familiar rolling stock, though I guess this probably isn't the best place to elaborate on such a niche interest.

                        I think the most remarkable rail journey I have made is the 55-hour sleeper service from Guangzhou/ Canton (Âª£Êù±Âª£Â∑û) to Tibet Lhasa (Ë•øËóèÊãâËñ©). That was my first time I ever went on a sleeper service, let alone one of the world's (distance-wise) longest and (altitude-wise) highest service. It was amazing to witness the diverse landscapes and cityscapes scrolling past my eyes, but getting to interact with people from diverse backgrounds was a joy as well!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other journey (or I should say experience) worth mentioning is my 2019 Welsh and Ffestiniog Highlands Heritage Railways tour, an ICRTS flagship event. Given my age, I do not have a particular attachment to steam railways, but I have always looked forward to witnessing the grandeur of steam railways. Connecting with and working alongside experienced veterans of the industry gave me new perspectives on the country's railway and its history, and made my first encounter with steam locomotives an absolutely remarkable experience! As a volunteer, we gained hands-on engineering experience, such as track laying and installing electrical mains at the depot, which was laborious but ultimately rewarding.

                        There are so many more journeys I would like to make post-coronavirus, and I very much look forward to them. Meanwhile, have a read at my (hopefully decently written) blogs on medium!
